# 🐱 Cat Café Management System

Welcome to the Cat Café Management System - a purr-fect example project for testing Gato!

## About This Project

This is a sample project designed to demonstrate Gato's features. It simulates a cat café management system with various features that let you practice different Git workflows.

## Getting Started

1. Copy this example project to a new directory
2. Initialize it with `gato spawn`
3. Start hunting and pouncing!

## Features to Implement

Here are some ideas for practicing with Gato:

### Phase 1: Basic Setup
- [ ] Initialize the repository (`gato spawn`)
- [ ] Add the initial files (`gato hunt .`)
- [ ] Make your first commit (`gato pounce -m "Initial setup"`)

### Phase 2: Cat Management
- [ ] Create a new branch for cat features (`gato scratch feature/cat-management`)
- [ ] Add cat profiles
- [ ] Implement adoption system
- [ ] Commit your changes (`gato pounce -m "Add cat management"`)

### Phase 3: Café Operations
- [ ] Create another branch (`gato scratch feature/cafe-operations`)
- [ ] Add menu system
- [ ] Implement order tracking
- [ ] Merge with main branch (`gato cuddle main`)

### Phase 4: Customer System
- [ ] Add customer registration
- [ ] Implement loyalty program
- [ ] Create customer reviews system

## Practice Commands

Try these Gato commands as you work:

```bash
# Start fresh
gato spawn

# Track your work
gato hunt src/
gato pounce -m "Add new feature"

# Branch management
gato scratch feature/new-feature
gato prowl feature/new-feature
gato cuddle main

# Check your progress
gato meowmory --oneline
gato meow-status

# Collaboration
gato leap origin main
gato fetch origin
```

## MEOW Token Opportunities

This project is designed to help you earn lots of MEOW tokens:

- **Multiple commits**: Each feature implementation = tokens
- **Branch workflows**: Practice scratching and cuddling
- **Daily coding**: Keep your streak alive
- **Code reviews**: Practice sniff checks (when implemented)

## Fun Challenges

1. **Speed Pouncer**: Make 10 commits in one session
2. **Branch Master**: Create and merge 5 different feature branches
3. **Memory Keeper**: Use `gato meowmory` to explore commit history
4. **Token Collector**: Earn 500 MEOW tokens with this project

## Real Implementation Ideas

If you want to actually build this (beyond just Git practice):

- Use Python/Flask for the backend
- React for the frontend
- SQLite for the database
- Docker for containerization
- Deploy with Heroku or similar

## Contributing

This is just an example project, but feel free to:
- Add more realistic code files
- Create more practice scenarios
- Suggest new Gato workflows
- Share your MEOW token achievements!

**Happy coding! May your cats be content and your tokens be many! 🐱💰**
