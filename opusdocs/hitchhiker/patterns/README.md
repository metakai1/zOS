## Pattern Template

Each pattern follows a consistent structure:

```markdown
# Pattern Name

## Problem
What specific problem does this pattern solve?

## Solution
How does the pattern solve the problem?

## Implementation
Step-by-step code examples and explanations.

## Usage Examples
Real-world usage from zOS codebase.

## Benefits
What advantages does this pattern provide?

## Trade-offs
What are the costs or limitations?

## Related Patterns
Links to complementary or alternative patterns.

## Testing Strategy
How to test code that uses this pattern.

## Common Pitfalls
Mistakes to avoid when implementing this pattern.
```

## Usage Guidelines

### When to Use Patterns
- **Problem Recognition**: You encounter a situation the pattern addresses
- **Code Review**: Patterns provide a shared vocabulary for discussing solutions
- **Architecture Decisions**: Patterns help evaluate different approaches
- **Onboarding**: Patterns accelerate learning for new team members

### When NOT to Use Patterns
- **Over-Engineering**: Don't use complex patterns for simple problems
- **Pattern Obsession**: Don't force patterns where they don't fit
- **Premature Optimization**: Use simple solutions first, patterns when needed
- **Cargo Culting**: Understand WHY a pattern works, not just HOW

### Adaptation Guidelines
- Patterns are starting points, not rigid rules
- Adapt patterns to your specific context and constraints
- Combine patterns thoughtfully when solving complex problems
- Document your adaptations for future reference

## Pattern Relationships

### Complementary Patterns
These patterns work well together:
- **Redux-Saga-Normalizr Trinity** + **Optimistic Updates**
- **Container-Presenter Pattern** + **Custom Hooks**
- **Saga Orchestration** + **Error Handling Flows**
- **Real-time State Sync** + **Connection Resilience**

### Alternative Patterns
These patterns solve similar problems with different trade-offs:
- **Render Props** vs **Custom Hooks**
- **Container-Presenter** vs **Custom Hooks**
- **Optimistic Updates** vs **Traditional Request-Response**

### Pattern Evolution
Some patterns build upon others:
- **Entity Normalization** ‚Üí **Selector Composition**
- **Basic Saga Flow** ‚Üí **Saga Orchestration**
- **Simple Components** ‚Üí **Compound Components**

## Contributing to the Pattern Library

### Adding New Patterns
1. Identify a recurring problem in the codebase
2. Document the solution using the pattern template
3. Include real examples from zOS where possible
4. Test the pattern implementation thoroughly
5. Review with team for accuracy and clarity

### Updating Existing Patterns
1. Document new use cases or variations
2. Add improved examples or implementations
3. Update related patterns and cross-references
4. Maintain backward compatibility when possible

### Pattern Quality Standards
- **Clarity**: Patterns should be easy to understand and follow
- **Completeness**: Include all necessary information for implementation
- **Accuracy**: Code examples should work and be tested
- **Relevance**: Patterns should solve real problems encountered in zOS

## Pattern Evolution and Deprecation

### Evolution Triggers
- New language or framework features
- Changed requirements or constraints
- Better solutions discovered through experience
- Performance or maintainability improvements

### Deprecation Process
1. **Mark as Deprecated**: Add deprecation notice with alternatives
2. **Migration Guide**: Provide clear path to newer patterns
3. **Gradual Migration**: Update existing code over time
4. **Final Removal**: Remove pattern after all usage is migrated
