## Chapter Structure

Each chapter follows the consistent structure:

1. **The Hook** (1-2 paragraphs) - Engaging opening that sets the stage
2. **The Promise** (1 paragraph) - What the reader will learn and why it matters  
3. **The Journey** (Main content) - Progressive disclosure with checkpoints
4. **The Payoff** (Exercises/Examples) - Hands-on proof of understanding
5. **The Portal** (What's next) - Connection to the next chapter
