# The Hitchhiker's Guide to zOS - Workshops

*"Learning without doing is like reading about swimming while drowning."*

This directory contains hands-on workshops and exercises designed to cement your understanding of zOS patterns through practical implementation. Every concept you learn should be something you can build.

## Workshop Philosophy

### Learn by Building
Every workshop is built around creating something functional and meaningful. You won't be building contrived examples - you'll be implementing real patterns that power real features in zOS.

### Progressive Complexity
Workshops are designed with the "towel principle" - start simple enough that you always know where you are, then progressively add complexity as your understanding grows.

### Real-World Context
All exercises are based on actual patterns used in zOS. When you complete a workshop, you'll understand not just how to implement the pattern, but why it was chosen and when to use it.
