## Chapter 1: The Signal

Maya's fingers trembled as she adjusted the makeshift antenna on the rooftop of the abandoned datacenter. Three years had passed since the Great Collapse of 2032, when the five megacorps that controlled the world's digital infrastructure had fallen like dominoes.

The centralized internet—humanity's nervous system for three decades—had died screaming.
