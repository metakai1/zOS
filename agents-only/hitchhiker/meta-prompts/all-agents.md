## Inter-Agent Communication Protocol

### Semaphore System
Agents use status files to coordinate:
```
./agents-only/hitchhiker/coordination/
├── status/
│   ├── chapter-01.status  # DRAFT | REVIEW | COMPLETE
│   ├── chapter-02.status
│   └── ...
├── requests/
│   ├── visual-requests.md
│   ├── pattern-analysis.md
│   └── exercise-topics.md
└── handoffs/
    ├── architect-to-explorer.md
    ├── explorer-to-storyteller.md
    └── storyteller-to-workshop.md
```

### Communication Codes
- `[READY]`: Content ready for next agent
- `[BLOCKED]`: Waiting on dependency
- `[REVIEW]`: Needs peer review
- `[HELP]`: Assistance requested
- `[DONE]`: Task complete

### Shared Resources
All agents maintain:
- Consistent terminology in glossary
- Unified code style examples
- Common voice and tone
- Shared metaphor library

## Orchestration Sequence

1. **Guide Architect** creates structure and coordinates
2. **Pattern Explorer** analyzes codebase patterns
3. **Code Storyteller** transforms technical content
4. **Workshop Master** creates exercises
5. **Visual Guide** adds diagrams
6. **Integration Synthesizer** assembles final book

Each agent can work in parallel once dependencies are met, using the coordination system to manage handoffs.
