# Hitchhiker's Guide to zOS - Initialization

## Project Overview
Creating "The Hitchhiker's Guide to zOS" - an educational deep-dive into the codebase for young, hungry developers.

## Agent Team Roster

1. **Guide Architect Agent** - Chief coordinator and structure designer
2. **Pattern Explorer Agent** - Code archaeologist uncovering advanced patterns
3. **Code Storyteller Agent** - Narrative transformer for engaging content
4. **Workshop Master Agent** - Hands-on exercise creator
5. **Visual Guide Agent** - Diagram and visual explanation specialist
6. **Integration Synthesizer Agent** - Final assembly and quality assurance

## Initial Task Assignments

### Phase 1: Foundation (Guide Architect)
- [ ] Analyze all documentation in `./opusdocs/`
- [ ] Create book structure and chapter outline
- [ ] Initialize coordination system
- [ ] Define learning objectives

### Phase 2: Deep Dive (Pattern Explorer)
- [ ] Analyze Redux-Saga-Normalizr patterns
- [ ] Document Matrix integration patterns
- [ ] Uncover performance optimizations
- [ ] Create pattern library

### Phase 3: Narrative (Code Storyteller)
- [ ] Transform technical content into stories
- [ ] Create engaging introductions
- [ ] Develop memorable examples
- [ ] Establish consistent voice

### Phase 4: Practice (Workshop Master)
- [ ] Design coding challenges
- [ ] Create debugging scenarios
- [ ] Build feature exercises
- [ ] Develop skill progression

### Phase 5: Visualization (Visual Guide)
- [ ] Create architecture diagrams
- [ ] Design flow charts
- [ ] Build component trees
- [ ] Illustrate data flows

### Phase 6: Integration (Integration Synthesizer)
- [ ] Assemble all content
- [ ] Create cross-references
- [ ] Build index and glossary
- [ ] Final quality check

## Communication Channels

### Status Files
- Location: `./agents-only/hitchhiker/coordination/status/`
- Format: `[AGENT_NAME]-[TASK].status`
- Values: `PENDING | IN_PROGRESS | REVIEW | COMPLETE`

### Handoff Protocol
1. Complete work and update status
2. Create handoff document in `./coordination/handoffs/`
3. Signal next agent with `[READY]` tag
4. Monitor for `[BLOCKED]` signals

## Success Metrics
- Comprehensive coverage of advanced patterns
- Engaging narrative that maintains technical accuracy
- Progressive exercises with clear learning outcomes
- Visual aids that clarify complex concepts
- Cohesive final product ready for young developers

## Launch Sequence
```bash
# 1. Initialize Guide Architect
/agent general-purpose "Using the Guide Architect meta-prompt from ./agents-only/hitchhiker/meta-prompts/all-agents.md, analyze the existing zOS documentation and create the structure for The Hitchhiker's Guide to zOS."

# 2. Begin Pattern Analysis
/agent general-purpose "Using the Pattern Explorer meta-prompt from ./agents-only/hitchhiker/meta-prompts/all-agents.md, analyze the Redux-Saga-Normalizr patterns in zOS and document the advanced architectural decisions."

# ... continue with other agents
```
