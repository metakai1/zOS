- **Blockers**: Any dependencies or issues
- **Handoffs**: Any work ready for other agents

### Handoff Procedures
1. **Complete Work**: Finish assigned deliverables
2. **Update Status**: Mark tasks complete in progress tracking
3. **Create Handoff Doc**: Document what's ready and what's needed
4. **Signal Next Agent**: Update coordination channels
5. **Monitor Progress**: Stay available for questions and clarification

### Communication Channels
- **Status Updates**: `/agents-only/hitchhiker/coordination/book-progress.md`
- **Handoff Docs**: `/agents-only/hitchhiker/coordination/handoffs/`
- **Issue Tracking**: `/agents-only/hitchhiker/coordination/issues.md`
- **Quality Gates**: `/agents-only/hitchhiker/coordination/qa-checklist.md`

### Coordination Signals
- `[READY]` - Work completed and ready for next agent
- `[BLOCKED]` - Waiting on dependency, need assistance
- `[REVIEW]` - Content ready for quality review
- `[HELP]` - Technical assistance requested
- `[DONE]` - Task fully completed and validated
